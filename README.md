# 🔧 Shell Command Interface in Python
📌 Overview :
<br>
This project is a custom-built command-line shell interface developed using Python. It mimics the behavior of traditional Unix shells and allows users to enter, execute, and interact with system-level commands through a clean and modular Python-based architecture.

🚀 Features: 
<br>
🖥️ Execute built-in and system commands

🔄 Support for command piping and redirection (if implemented)

📦 Modular components for command execution, user interaction, and shell interface

⚙️ Easily extendable for custom shell behaviors or scripting capabilities
